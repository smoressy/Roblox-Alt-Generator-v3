## Installation Guide

## Use Different Chrome Profiles
For the best experience, it's recommended to install this extension on an alternative Chrome profile. Installing it on your main profile might interfere with your primary Roblox experience.

## Password Generation
Usernames generated by this tool have a simple password system: the password is just the username repeated twice. For example, if the username is `apple`, the password will be `appleapple`. This makes logging in faster and easier.
